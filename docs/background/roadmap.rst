Roadmap
==================

:code:`entremets` is a slowly growing project.
The following features need be implemented before 1.0.0 release.

* True | False
* not and or
* FOR { UPDATE | NO KEY UPDATE | SHARE | KEY SHARE }
* Select x.*
* AS alias
* Inner join
* Left outer join
* right outer join
* On conflict Do nothing
* On conflict Do update Set
* Create Constraint Check
* NOWAIT | SKIP LOCKED
* Sub-Select
* Returning
* Unary + -
* do … catch … end
* Parsing documentation
* State graph
* Temporal properties

That's a lot of work still. We estimate the work to be over at the end of summer 2023.
The next milestone is confronting :code:`entremets` to production like scenarios.
